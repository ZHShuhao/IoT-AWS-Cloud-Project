# ioT_Project
This is a ioT project about design of DHT22 Temperature and humidity, AWS Cloud and Webpage

# Project background
Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the real-time collection of any object or process that needs monitoring, connection and interaction through various devices and technologies such as various information sensors.As one of the low-power wide-area network communication technologies, LoRa can achieve characteristics that cannot be realized by traditional wireless sensor networksâ€”at the same time, it has the advantages of long transmission distance and low power consumption.During the cold chain transportation, incorrect temperature can cause very serious financial loss. With the development of Internet of Things technology. The data of the current environment can be obtained in real time and uploaded to the cloud for analysis and monitoring.

# 1. How to connect DHT22 Tempurature and humidity sensor to ESP32 LoRa borad
## physical connection

## Software config
Using PlateformIO in the VSCode deveploper tool, install the corresponding development library. In this project we use AWS_IOT library to connect to AWS cloud, Audrino library to config ESP32 development board; DHT22 library to connect DHT22 sensor and MYSQL library to store envarinment data.

There are lots of office thrild library can be used directely to developt ESP32 board.

# 2. Config AWS
Open the AWS cloud and create virtual things corresponding to the devices of real world.

# 3. LoRa protocol

LoRa is a low-power, long-range, wireless, wide-area network standard created by semtech.

Working frequency: ISM frequency band includes 433, 868, 915 MH, etc.

# 4. MQTT protocol.
MQTT is a lightweight message transmission protocol based on the publish/subscribe model. It is specially designed for IoT applications in low-bandwidth and unstable network environments. It can provide real-time and reliable message services for networked devices with very little code. Simple and easy to implement

# 5. Project Architeture
In this iot project, we implement two way to connect to AWS. Implementation 1 use both LoRa and MQTT protocol. DHT22 sent envarinment data to ESP32 borad directely, then endnotd ESP32 board process and send data to the another ESP32 board which connect to the internet. When ESP32 board which is conneted to the internet receive the data from endnode successfully, it send these data through MQTT protocol to the AWS cloud and store data into the MYSQL database.
At last, user can check enviranment data through different endnote device like Ipad, Phone and laptop. What's more, users can observe the time-to-time change of data by browsing the line chart on the web page.

 Implementation 2 implement three end nodes connect to AWS directly and independently. Three end nodes send envarinment data to the AWS cloud directly through MQTT protocol.

# How devices connect to the AWS
If want devices join the AWS, every device need a certificate from AWS. Now we will config certificate for devices.

# Show & Analyz data
Data will be send to AWS and stored into the MySQL database. User can choose way which they like to observe the tempurature and humidity data, at the same time, user can also observe time-to-time change of data by browsing the line chart on the web page.
